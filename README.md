## Hi, I'm LinsaFTW ðŸ‘‹

I'm a CEO and full-stack developer from Argentina who loves creating web apps, mobile apps and games. I'm the founder of ArkFlame Network, a Minecraft server network, and [ArkFlame Development](https://github.com/arkflame), a software development company. I have created or contributed to several open source projects, such as [FlameCord](https://builtbybit.com/resources/flamecord-ultimate-antibot-solution.13492/), [ExploitFixer](https://builtbybit.com/resources/exploitfixer-anti-crash-dupe-plugin.26463/) and [HamsterAPI](https://github.com/2lstudios-mc/HamsterAPI). I'm currently learning React Native and Flutter to build native apps for various platforms. You can follow me on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/LinsaFTW) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LinsaFTW) or contact me via GitHub. I'm always open to new challenges and opportunities!
