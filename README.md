# 👋 About Me

Software developer from Argentina.  
Coding since 2010. What started as a simple hobby ended up becoming my profession. I specialize in Minecraft development and AI research, with a strong focus on performance, security, and server architecture.

I build high-performance plugins and server modifications for Minecraft and actively pursue entrepreneurship in the software space.

## 🧱 Minecraft Development

I create plugins and custom forks for Minecraft servers using Spigot, Paper, and BungeeCord/Waterfall platforms.  
My focus is on performance, stability, anti-exploit systems, and solving real issues that server owners face.

## 📖 My Journey

In 2010, I launched my first Minecraft server **Battleon2**, inspired by Adventure Quest. Over time, the server evolved through different names: **CalyptoCraft**, **JoltCraft**, **Legion Escorpion**, and eventually **ArkFlame Network**.

Running my own server brought real technical challenges—bot attacks, lag, memory leaks—which forced me to learn how to defend and optimize my server stack. That's when I discovered Linux, iptables, Java, and the Bukkit API.

Despite being unfamiliar with Linux, I dove in. It was difficult at first, switching from Windows and not knowing a single command—but I was determined. Eventually, I learned how to leverage it for maximum performance and hardened security.

## 📡 Hardware & Hosting

I also explored the world of hosting providers and data centers. I learned that not all providers are created equal—many promise resources but fail to deliver stability and backend quality. I even set up my own physical machine in a nearby data center to have full control over infrastructure.

---

## 🔧 From Plugins to Platforms

Later on, I started developing my own plugins and forks of BungeeCord and Paper to solve performance and security problems from the core. One major issue was how most anti-bot systems were plugin-based and added unnecessary load through reflection. So I made **FlameCord** and **FlamePaper**—leaner, faster, more secure alternatives.

What began as internal tools for my server turned into public projects. I began publishing them on **SpigotMC** and **BuiltByBit** so others could benefit from the same tools—and so I could learn from the feedback of the community. Initially all open source and free.

Now, this effort has evolved into a community: **ArkFlame Development**, a growing ecosystem of tools and server tech with both free and paid plugins for broader Minecraft use cases—chat filtering (ChatSentinel), exploit fixing (ExploitFixer), and more.
